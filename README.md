# Accessibility Dashboard Webservice (backend for Accessibility Dashboard Frontend)

This web service allows you to store Accessibility audits generated by [CrawlKit](https://github.com/crawlkit/crawlkit) via a REST interface and query them. It also keeps aggregated statistics over time and is capable of handling gigabytes of data.

To display the data, use the [Accessibility Dashboard Frontend](https://github.com/a11y-dashboard/frontend) and hook it up to this web service.

## Project Features

* Loading CrawlKit audits via REST (`/load.crawlkit`).
* Querying aggregated statistics data via REST (`/overview`)
* Querying audit details via REST (`/details`)
* Querying statistics data of audit details via REST (`/details.stats`)

## Getting started
Download the source code and run `npm install`. You will also need docker and to make things easier docker-compose.

You can spin up a dev instance via running `npm run dev:tdd` - this will need a running docker daemon.

### Postgres

#### dump
```
pg_dump postgres://... -F c -Z 9 > dump.backup
```

#### restore
```
pg_restore -d results -h `docker-machine ip default` -p 54321 -U postgres -c --role=postgres dump.backup
```

## How to contribute
PRs are welcome!

Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`) and the tests are green (`npm test` or when using `npm run dev:tdd` they are run continuously).
